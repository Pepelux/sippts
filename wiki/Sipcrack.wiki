#summary Sipcrack tool

Sipcrack is a remote password cracker. Sipcrack uses multithread and using a wordlist can test passwords for several users in IP and port ranges.

= Features =
Sipcrack allows us to:
  * Test remotely a list of users and passwords using REGISTER method
  * Test users and passwords on a network range
  * Use a prefix for extensions range (maybe user and extension is not the same)
