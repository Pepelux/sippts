#summary Sipscan tool

Sipscan is a very fast scanner for SIP services over UDP. It uses multithread and can scan large ranges of networks.

= Features =

Sipscan works sending and waiting well formed SIP packages. For example, Nmap is a great tool for network's scanning, but over UDP is better and quicker sending well formed packages and waiting for valid responses.

Sipscan allows us to:
  * Identify SIP servers and devices.
  * Use different methods like as REGISTER, INVITE or OPTIONS.
  * Scan a server target or large ranges of network.
  * Scan large ranges of ports.
  * Analyze responses using verbose mode.

SipSCAN - by Pepelux <pepeluxx@gmail.com>
-------

Usage: perl sipscan.pl -h <host> [options]
 
== Options ==
-m <string>      = Method: REGISTER/INVITE/OPTIONS (default: OPTIONS)
-u  <string>     = Username
-s  <integer>    = Source number (CallerID) (default: 100)
-d  <integer>    = Destination number (default: 100)
-r  <integer>    = Remote port (default: 5060)
-ip <string>     = Source IP (by default it is the same as host)
-v               = Verbose (trace information)
-vv              = More verbose (more detailed trace)
}}}

==Examples==
   * To search SIP services on 192.168.0.1 port 5060 (using OPTIONS method)
{{{
$perl sipscan.pl -h 192.168.0.1
}}}
   * To search SIP services on 192.168.0.0 network
{{{
$perl sipscan.pl -h 192.168.0.0/24
}}}
   * To search a large range of SIP services (using REGISTER method)
{{{
$perl sipscan.pl -h 192.168.0.1-192.168.254.254 -m REGISTER
}}}
   * To search a large network range of SIP services on a large port range (using INVITE method)
{{{
$perl sipscan.pl -h 192.168.0.1-192.168.254.254 -r 5060-5090 -m INVITE
